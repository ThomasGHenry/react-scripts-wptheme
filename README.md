# react-scripts-wptheme

## Please Note, this is the last update to this scripts package. I'll be maintaining a full fork of Facebook's "create-react-app" here: [devloco/create-react-app](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-app)

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React WP Theme](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:

-   [Getting Started](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new WordPress theme.
-   [User Guide](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme/blob/master/create-react-app-USERGUIDE.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App (applicable to Create React WP Theme too).
